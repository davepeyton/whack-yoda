# My Game <br>


### In the original game ( Whack a mole) the goal is to memorise where the mole pops up and then try to whack the mole before it returns beneath the hole. <br> The rules are similar in my game but instead of whacking a mole you are whacking a baby Yoda. 
# Game Rules <br>
### There are four levels, each level more challenging the the previous. You have 3 lives to complete each level.
# Game Play <br>
### You have to whack as many baby yoda’s as you can within a 10 second time limit. As you progress through the levels the baby yoda’s will pop up faster making each level more challenging than the previous. <br> You have three lives to complete each level. Each time you miss a baby yoda you loose a life. 
<br>

# Creation Process <br>
### I wrote some html to get some structure on the game. <br> 
After I had all the html code written I check the code through a validator!. All good .
