# Creation Process <br>
### *After alot of consideration I decided to create a game as my 2nd milestone project. The "whack a mole" game in particular is one of my favorate games. So I was eager to build one myself. Using html I managed to get some structure on the game. With Css I was able to style the look of the game and change backgrounds. I used JS mainly for the functionality of the game*.

# Testing
<br>

### *All my html and css code was tested through css and html validators*.
<br>
